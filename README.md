# Feasible Path Planning for Cars and Pedestrians using Imitation Learning

## Problem Statement
Learn Cost Maps for feasible paths for cars and pedestrians using imitation of an oracle.

## Usage Guide:
1. Run `WrapperCar.m` for running Test Script for Car Planner.
2. Run `WrapperPedestrian.m` for running Test Script for Pedestrian Planner.
3. The training Codes for `Car` and `Pedestrian` are named `TrainCar.m` and `TrainPredestrian.m` respectively.
4.  The `.mat` file with CostMap for Car and Pedestrain are called `CarModel.mat` and `PedestrainModel.mat`.

## Report:
You can find the report [here](Report/ESE650Project5.pdf).
